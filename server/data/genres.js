      "description": "Vaporwave is a subgenre of electronic music that originated on the internet in the early 2010s. It is characterized by its heavy use of sampling from 80s and 90s corporate music, smooth jazz, elevator music, and other audio associated with consumer capitalism. The genre slows down and distorts these samples to create a nostalgic, surreal, and sometimes unsettling atmosphere. Vaporwave is often accompanied by visual aesthetics that include glitchy VHS graphics, neon colors, and early internet iconography. Initially starting as a satirical critique of consumer culture, it has since evolved into a broader musical and artistic movement."

      "description": "Shoegaze is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged in the UK in the late 1980s. It is characterized by ethereal vocals and a heavy use of guitar effects, creating a dense 'wall of sound' with layers of reverb and distortion. The genre got its name from performers’ tendency to 'gaze' at their shoes while using multiple guitar pedals during performances. Shoegaze evokes a dreamy, immersive atmosphere, often blending melody with noise. Though niche, it has influenced many modern bands and experienced a resurgence in popularity."
